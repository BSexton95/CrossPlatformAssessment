# Click-n-Roll

## Overview
Click-n-Roll is a cross platform 3D game made in Unity. The players goal is to drag a ball
across a track, avoiding obstacles along the way, to make it the the end goal.

## Controls
### PC
The mouse is all you need to play on PC. When holding down left click and dragging the
mouse across the screen, the ball will follow wherever the mouse pointer goes.

### Phone
By dragging a finger across the touch screen the ball will follow along.

## Known Bugs
When the mouse pointer or finger are placed in front of an obstacle it can cause issues with the ball movement. 
An example, if you are moving forward and the pointer or finger is placed on an obstacle the ball will stop moving or
move backs rather than forward.
